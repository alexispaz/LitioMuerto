# Compilation 

Instead, if you want to clone from GitHub then:

    git clone git@github.com:alexispaz/LitioMuerto.git
    cd LitioMuerto
    autoreconf -fi
    ./configure
    make

Further compiling options are handle
in a standar way. For instance:

    export PATH=/share/apps/gcc/6.2.0/bin/:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/share/apps/gcc/6.2.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export FC=gfortran
    exportÂ FCFLAGS=-fno-use-linker-plugin
	./configure --disable-openmp FCFLAGS='-Ofast'

See `./configure --help` for more information

To create a tar ball to run in other computers without autotools use:
  
    make dist

then you only need to configure and make (i.e. `./configure; make`).
